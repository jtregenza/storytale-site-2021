_This casestudy has not been asked for by the subject and is an unoffical exercise in Storytale's process of the hero's journey._

In Franz Kafka's, Die Verwandlung (_The Metamorphosis_), the salesman Gregor Samsa awakens to find himself transformed into a monstrous vermin, detested by a society that now no longer has use or need for him. He was once the benefactor, able to ensure his entire family was provided for but once transformed he can no longer speak or live in the world changed.

The metamorphosis is sudden to Gregor but he is personally unaffected by it, the perception of him by the world around him is where the changes are most evident. His interactions with his family, employer and house guests are where we witness the harshest effects. 

Gregor's transformation was seemingly sudden but the affects it had on his life and other took time to fully realise.

In 1999, Cash Converters, the Australian second-hand goods retailer launched it's Cash Advance product and morphed it's income streams to include paypay loans and personal finance. As of May 2021, Cash Converters saw an increase of 14%, with the majority of growth coming from small and medium amount credit contracts[1](https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/asx-ccv/announcements/2021-06-15/6a1036753/ccv-business-update/).

In this tale, the role of Gregor is being played by Cash Converters, a company more personal financing then second-hand retailer. The metamorphosis leading to diversify the revenue streams of the business but seemingly neglected their second-hand roots. 

By the end of the tale, we seek to make another metamorphosis, one that maintains a strong story true to Cash Converters and aligns with the changing world.

In choosing Cash Converters as one of our fantasy case studies we looked into where they have been, what story they have put out and where we at Storytale could take the business.

Looking into the company, it's class action settlement in 2019 and it's recent revenue increases due to payday loans left a bad taste in our mouths, like biting into an apple and finding half a worm.

This left us with a few questions:
- Is this the right company for Storytale?
- Does the marketplace have a gap that the company could fill?
- How much change would we make in order to bring this company inline with our own views and mentality?

Cash Converters as a personal finance company really isn't the of company we want to associate with. Pay day loans, cash advances and sub prime loans have disproportionate affect poorer individuals and families and practices of predatory lending have run rampant. This isn't us accusing Cash Converters of predatory lending (As part of the 2019 class action suite's settlement Cash Converters did not admit liability in the alleged consumer law breaches). It's also very weird that for their website to mark federal government reforms and amendments as company milestones.

Cash Converters as a second-hand retailer has some openings though, especially once we look to their contemporaries.

The main competition to the likes of Cash Converters second-hand market are products like Facebook Marketplace and Gumtree. The peer to peer marketplace for second hand goods has grown rapidly from with Ebay being a precursor and depop starting to make second hand clothing resale very trendy.

How would Cash Converters keep up with the this marketplace and make a case for itself? By providing greater safety to the buyers and sellers.

A core part of the peer to peer is the collection of the goods at the end of the transaction, either through post or going to the sellers home.

Whether imagined or not, there are safety concerns about going ot a persons home to then collect goods and exchange cash for, you've probably only known this person through your brief conversation and don't fully know the person you are going to meet. 

Josh isn't an avid buyer or seller but he is ever present in transactions along with his partner, either being the person the buyers solely meets when the buyer picks up items from their house or being there at the property of the seller when it's his time to collect.

It's in this gap in the marketplace where a brick and mortar store that Cash Converters has (with over 150 stores across Australia) can be utilised and lead to larger innovation for the company around second hand retail.

We have now reached the point in our tale for our hero to reach Apotheosis, the metamorphosis from Cash Converters to a brand that will take the next steps in safe peer to peer exchange of second hand items. Introducing HAGL.

HAGL creates a pointed departure from the Cash Converters brand and pawn shop aesthetic into the trendy space that is only really occupied by Depop. Cash is less prevalent in Australia, and while Cash Converters as a brand has been around for nearly 40 years, detaching HAGL for a fresher brand away from the former brand will invigorate the customer base. With this brand we increase from just instruments, electronics and jewelry and allows individuals to make more possible.

We took out the maroon and yellow colours and make HAGL black and white, to draw attention to the HAGLers and their items for sale. 

 HAGL operates in the digital and physical spheres through two ways: the HAGL app and the HAGL post.

The HAGL app faciliates peer to peer communication and individual storefronts for HAGLers and Buyers. As a HAGLer, you can post your items of the app and connect with avid buyers to convert your items into funds. Buyers can follow their favourite HAGLers and make purchases through contactless payment. By having the core area of business to the app, it creates a ecosystem of haggling at any time of the day and not just when the stores are open.

The HAGL post is the physical store comes to play. Harkening back to the Trading Posts of yore, this is where buyers and HAGLers can drop off and pick up their items from the HAGL boxes. Once a HAGL has been confirmed, the HAGLer drops the item into their preferred HAGL Post where one of the staff then confirms the item is what is being sold and then transports the item into the appropriate HAGL boxes (which come in 4 specific sizes). By transforming the stores into trading posts that only have stock when sales have occurred, this seeks to decrease the depreciating or lost stock that Cash Converters accumulates year on year. The consumer then has piece of mind when collecting from the HAGL post in their own safety, with check in facilities and lock posts for their items. 

The proposed metamorphosis to take the second-hand retailer to a peer-to-peer marketplace with brick and mortar collection establishment so that more focus can
