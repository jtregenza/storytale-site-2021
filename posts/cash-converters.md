_This casestudy has not been asked for by the subject and is an unoffical exercise in Storytale's process of the hero's journey._

In Franz Kafka's, Die Verwandlung (_The Metamorphosis_), the salesman Gregor Samsa awakens to find himself transformed into a monstrous vermin, detested by a society that now no longer has use or need for him. He was once the benefactor, able to ensure his entire family was provided for but once transformed he can no longer speak or live in the world changed.

The metamorphosis is sudden to Gregor but he is personally unaffected by it, the perception of him by the world around him is where the changes are most evident. His interactions with his family, employer and house guests are where we witness the harshest effects. 

Gregor's transformation was seemingly sudden but the affects it had on his life and other took time to fully realise.

In 1999, Cash Converters, the Australian second-hand goods retailer launched it's Cash Advance product and morphed it's income streams to include paypay loans and personal finance. As of May 2021, Cash Converters saw an increase of 14%, with the majority of growth coming from small and medium amount credit contracts[1](https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/asx-ccv/announcements/2021-06-15/6a1036753/ccv-business-update/).

In this tale, the role of Gregor is being played by Cash Converters, a company more personal financing then second-hand retailer. The metamorphosis leading to diversify the revenue streams of the business but seemingly neglected their second-hand roots. 

By the end of the tale, we seek to make another metamorphosis, one that mantains the original story of Cash Converters and aligns with the changing world.

Looking into the company, it's class action settlement in 2019 and it's recent revenue increases due to payday loans left a bad taste in our mouths, like biting into an apple and finding half a worm.

This left us with a few questions:
- Is this the right company for Storytale?
- Does the marketplace have a gap that the company could fill?
- How much change would we make in order to bring this company inline with our own views and mentality?

Cash Converters as a personal finance company really isn't the of company we want to associate with. Pay day loans, cash advances and sub prime loans have disproportionate affect poorer individuals and families and practices of predatory lending have run rampant. This isn't us accusing Cash Converters of predatory lending (As part of the 2019 class action suite's settlement Cash Converters did not admit liability in the alleged consumer law breaches).

Cash Converters as a second-hand retailer has some openings though, especially once we look to their contemporaries.

The main competition to the likes of Cash Converters second-hand market are products like Facebook Marketplace and Gumtree. The peer to peer marketplace for second hand goods has grown rapidly from with Ebay being a precursor and depop starting to make second hand clothing resale very trendy.

How would Cash Converters keep up with the this marketplace and make a case for itself? By providing greater safety to the buyers and sellers.

A core part of the peer to peer is the collection of the goods and the
