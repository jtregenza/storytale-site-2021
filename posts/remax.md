One of the things that confused us the most about RE/MAX brand is the logo and their the hot air balloon. Why does a real estate company hold the balloon in high regard and what has kept it around for so long.

Back in 1978, one of the franchises in New Mexico joing in the Albuquerque Hot Air Balloon Fiesta and it engaged with customers and head office so much, the balloon has become synonymous with the RE/MAX brand. Across American and Australia you can actually pay to fly in one of the many RE/MAX balloons in circulation. 

The Balloon has endured with the brand because it sticks with the story of RE/MAX's inception story. Dave Liniger and Gail Main (The two would marry soon after) started Real Estate Maximums, because they believed that by elevating the Real Estate Agents and giving them the tools to sell real estate they would find greater success.

The Balloon is the perfect icon for elevation which is why when we took at look at RE/MAX we saw the opportunity to merge the Hot Air Balloon directly into the logo.

The colours wouldn't need to be changed as they have become such a rich part of the existing brand. Highlighting them more with the balloon logo would be the largest shift we feel to make.

The new logo is complimented with the balloon component being added to the brand, the peak of a baloon emerging from below and rising into promience.
