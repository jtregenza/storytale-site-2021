### A family affair

“It’s a Sunday night and you’re sitting at the dining table waiting for the door to open. You hear the clunking of keys in the lock as you turn you head to see dad come in; white shopping bags full as you all cheer out in jubilation. Dinner’s here! Without a pause he comes over to the table and pulls out the boxes and clear takeaway containers that will inevitably fill up a draw in the kitchen. You wait as the steaming hot peas are scooped out onto your plate. Then a tong full of those nice golden chips, the best part of any takeaway meal. Your nose is filled with that rich smell of the hero of dinner, the roast chicken. Its tender white meat encased in that coveted caramelised skin. Cut up and put on your plate and drowned in that brown gravy from the tub. You pick your knife and fork and slice off a portion of the chicken and add it to a skewering of chips and stuff in your mouth. Yum!”

### The project

For those growing up in Australia, many would remember the Sunday night roast. Sometimes it was homemade, hours spent lovingly prepared by your parents. Other times it was takeaway from the family’s favourite place down the road. Fish & chips, Chinese or Chicken shop. For Queenslanders Brodie’s was once a big player in this space. A local competitor to the more popular Red Rooster and international KFC franchises. While these two companies focused on a generic feast for a family with mass produced chicken, Brodies always had that extra level of feeling like a home cooked meal. More options for vegetables and roast potatoes instead of just chips.

Over the years the chain has gone down hill and in 2014 it almost went under and had to close shop. In a fast-moving space where the bigger players were getting more streamlined, Brodies went the other way and began to expand its menu. The rise of families becoming more health conscious left the store in a dire position.

When I went to visit one of the few remaining Brodies near me, I found it a shell of its hay day. The menu was huge and was focused on burgers now. Even its tagline had changed to further drive the point home it was now a second-rate burger take away store. The stores once had a comfy country vibe with nice wooden furniture and low hanging lights. Now it was white and sterile with a metal bench. The menu was a confusing mess, and I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of things I could get.

The story of being a local chain from a country town was long gone. It had lost its soul. Storytale thought we should have a crack and making a new one for a new era.

### Food for the new era

What we wanted to do with this project is look at how we can evolve the story of the humble chicken store into something that played closer to its original roots, while also taking advantage of a more health-conscious customer.

The store started out as a roast chicken takeaway store. Filling a niche of having better quality takeaway dinners for families than the larger franchises. As the world moves faster and the norm shifts to both parents working in a family. The ability to cook a good healthy dinner for the family starts to be restricted by time. The easy option is to get some takeaway on the way home instead. A trend that is clearly picking up as even places like McDonalds and Hungry Jack’s are jumping on the cheap and easy family meal band wagon. But like many, dining on Macca’s every week can make you a bit guilty.

In comes Brodies. Gone are the burgers and old school takeaway items and in comes the expansion of its homemade style family dinners. A simple and straight forward menu that lets you build your own meal while keeping things health and putting in better habits without feeling guilty about feeding everyone.

So what was the new story we wanted to tell?

> Food made good.

It’s healthy, its simple, it’s a little bit fancy and you can make it your way.

### A new symbol

To give this new direction a stamp we created a new logo. Taking the big Brodies B we merged that with the recommended food proportion plate top create a new B in the shape of the meal boxes we envision the store being based around. Pairing that with a hand painted word mark to give it a more handcrafted feel.

### Little bit cheeky

Part of refreshing the brand was to look at how we can tell a story of good food. Along with a striking colour palette and more modern font we added in illustrations of food with a bit of a cheeky twist to them. Mascots for the brand that are nothing more than fresh food instead of animals or characters. We wanted them along with the copy to have a classic Aussie cheekiness to them.

For marketing we kept things simple and wanted to reinforce the main message of Brodies. Food made good. The whole process has been stripped down to something akin to the subway or kebab making experience.

Pick your vegies, pick a side and added a protein. That’s it. Three steps. We also chose to make the vegies the first and biggest choice instead of the more standard meat to encourage people to think about greens being the hero of the meal instead of the protein. Helping to form better eating habits.

We wanted to reduce the menu of Brodies down to few, but better options. Then allow the customer to pick what combinations they wanted from there.  Everything is reduced down to a vegetable, side or protein to go in the box. The only other options being a traditional roast gravy sandwich or some pork crackling. Those guilty pleasures that hit the sweet spot that you can’t get anywhere else.

Then all of that is put together into colourful recyclable packaging. Whether it be for dinner or for lunch. You know you’re getting a good meal.

Along with that we simplified the website. Encouraging users to go right to ordering via one of the delivery partners or getting pick up. There is also a menu on the site to entice users with the delicious meals.

### Keeping it simple

When it comes to telling stories it’s important to keep that central theme strong. For brands that means sticking in that niche that makes you who you are. Don’t be afraid of it and then try and branch out into things that detract from that theme. Make that theme your personality and people will love you for it.
