## Intro

Growing up in Australia most people would remember the Sunday night family dinner. 9/10 times it being a big roast lamb with baked vegies and a lake of gravy over it all. The peas drowning like little sailors. The Sunday roast is a tradition that throws back to our English colonial roots from before the first settlers landed on our shores. For many this idea of a big family meal also spilled across to other nights of the week. Friday fish and chips was always a welcome treat that carried the same bonding time.

In this busy day and age, the ability to spend time all day cooking a big family meal is a tricky challenge. The rise of both parents working jobs means that there is that often occurrence of one or both coming home from work exhausted and in no mood to then cook for the kids as well.

This shift of society has seen the rise of the takeaway family meals. Many fast food joints have gotten on the band wagon of having an option to feed a family for cheap when no one is in the mood for cooking. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and is a symptom of our ever stressful attitude of our working lives. 

What is bad is just what these places are serving us and our children. Burgers, pizza, crumbed fish and if you're lucky, a whole chicken with processed sides that defeat the purpose. The roast meal or even the well prepared week night dinner dying off to what's easier. Especially with the rise of delivery services like UberEats.

While we can't solve giving families time to cook for themselves. We can provide them an alternative option that provides a healthy dinner that they won't feel guilty about.  

## The current story

Anyone from Brisbane and Queensland in general has been to the local competitor to Red Rooster; Brodies. I remember going their after school with my friends to grab a box of chips. Unlike the clinically modern Red Roosters, Brodie stores always had a touch of that country town aesthetic without trying. It felt local, even if it was a chain. The menu was full of that good roast chicken and homemade sides that no other takeaway store sold. A good alternative to the others.

But whether it was from the market forces of the day trying to push it towards being more like its International competitors or just the cultural standards of the 90s it slowly began to fade away. 2016 it went into volentarry solvetray and was sold off. Stores closed across the state and were replaced by competitors. 

I had completely forgotten about it until recently when I had a sudden urge for a good roast sandwich. So I found where the nearest store was and had a look inside. It was like coming back to your home town after many years away. Expecting to be welcomed back by childhood memories, you instead and greeted with a shell of what it once was. The charm of the old stores gone. The menu now a mess of way too many options and most of them an attempt to replicate other places. Even the staple roast meals had been pushed to the corner of the wall.

It was now a second rate burger shop that even was too late to the already diverse boutique burger scene. When I got the meal, I was still greeted with the same old packaging as I was 15 years ago. What had changed wasn't for the better and what remained the same wasn't helpful. It's soul was gone. 

## Changing things up

This situation might seen dire, but its not the end. What separates a fast food store to a good old family take away shop is the story. We might have stories of ourselves at Maccas. But you could replace that location with any other one and still get the same story. Places like old Brodies were part of the story. Stories of dinner with the family or rolling on in your school uniform to try and impress the girls in your class with chips after school (This never worked!). 

So how do we bring the story back to Brodies?
