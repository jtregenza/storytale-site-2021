Seasonal wants to help you save a few dollars and maybe help the world while you are at it. As much as we all enjoy a good Strawberry, when is the right time to get the 3 dollar punit bursting with flavour. Better still, where can you buy the best strawberries where you are located. 

My world's on fire and buying practices need to change in order to create corporate culture shifts so it's less on fire and more livable. 

The roadmap is cultivated into six questions that Seasonal will answer: 
1. When to buy?
2. Where to buy?
3. How to Cook?
4. What to Grow?
5. How to Grow?
6. How to Support Others?

Ambitious in it's goal but simple in premise, by building Seasonal we want to help you cook more locally and sustainably with fresher produce.

Keep an eye out for the Seasonal App to help you in the grocer aisle soon.
