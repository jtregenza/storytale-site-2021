Food ties us together, it shows who we are, where we came from and what may come to us. Food matters. 

At Storytale we want to help with what matters. That's why we are making Seasonal, a tool to help cook with fresher produce and maybe even grow the freshest produce. We want to give you the knowledge and know how to be more in touch with the food you eat and when is best to buy it. Shopping fresher means you will know when you can or cannot make certain meals and help save you money ($2 punnets of strawberries taste much better than $10 punnets).

The seedlings of Seasonal have only just broken through the soil and the studio is building out the app for your glorious consumption. We want to help you know when is best to buy, when is best to grow but also how to cook the produce you now have at your disposal. That is going to grow organically from there. Food ties us together, it matters and so do you.
