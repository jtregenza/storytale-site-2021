Food ties us together, it shows who we are, where we came from and what may come to us. Food matters. 

At Storytale we want to help with what matters. That's why we are making Seasonal, a tool to help cook with fresher produce and maybe even grow the freshest produce. We want to give you the knowledge and know how to be more in touch with the food you eat and when is best to buy it. Shopping fresher means you will know when you can or cannot make certain meals and help save you money ($2 punnets of strawberries taste much better than $10 punnets).

The seedlings of Seasonal have only just broken through the soil and the studio is building out the app for your glorious consumption. We want to help you know when is best to buy, when is best to grow but also how to cook the produce you now have at your disposal. That is going to grow organically from there. Food ties us together, it matters and so do you.

Food ties us together. It shows who we are, where we come. Where we come from and what may come, of us. Food Matters, from very young age, it has been the act of cooking. That has been a great de stressor to create meals for others and to bring them around dinner table. That shirt to see joy. That's, that's great importance. One of the things when you're cooking is you want to be able to push yourself, or, you know, read a recipe, and it'll call for something outside of your comfort zone. And so you'll start looking for them and you'll try and find the right thing at the right time. Sometimes that means you've got to capture data. Alright Josh seasonal food ties us together, shows us who we are, where we come from and what may come, of us. Food Matters. If food matters to us, then the type of food should matter as well. What seasonal is trying to accomplish is to give people greater knowledge of the food that they consume. They want to be able. Well, we want you to be able to do more with the food that matters to you. It started. The idea started like going into a supermarket, and seeing strawberries for $10 upon an outrageous cost, but we didn't know that that was going to be the case. It's so expensive because there isn't enough supply. We didn't know that. We were out of season for it. So what we're looking at is knowing when to buy the right food, so that you're getting the freshest produce. If you do that, you're going to make better food choices. That's going to be getting strawberries for equitable prices. It's going to be making sure that what you are getting is going to be the freshest and freshest, so that the food that you then make with it is going to be the best it could be seasonal is an application that gives you that information that imparts that knowledge to you, and allows you to think differently about food. By going through the app, setting up notifications of when things are going to be in season. You'll be able to make more informed choices. Why stop there. Why should you just know what what foods are in season right now. But going down this more sustainable route. By understanding when seasonality is at its best. You can also start getting more knowledge about where to buy things, the right places to go. The places that mean that there is not going to be as much of a environmental impact from your purchases. It's through changing buying habits that we are able to make such a large shift in how this world produces its food. Again, why stop there. Why not go from knowing when something is in season to going where to buy those in season produce to then going, Well, how am I going to grow that produce myself. It's a tall order. Yes, but what we're doing here is we're putting the seeds in in place so that over time, and as we build out seasonal. We seek to grow and to be able to claim those ambitious goals. Harvest half the harvest.
