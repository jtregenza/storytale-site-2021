		<h1>Fables</h1>

		We believe in storytelling, not sure if you have caught on yet. We also want to empower people to tell their own stories and easily as possible. That's why we are making Fables, a story creation and management tool. 

We started Fables before Storytale was a thing and us working on it set the stage for the inception, so it's just as much a Storytale creation tool. 

We are both game masters for tabletop role playing games and one of the things that derails improvisational storytelling is having to come up with a name for the the character you off handedly mentioned while painting the scene for your players. This is where we have started with Fables, character name generation. 

You can try it out right now, roll up your new character.

This is great for off the cuff naming that feel real to the world you are creating or even coming up with Random Names for placeholder names in designs (in the HAGL mockups, the names found were generator using Fables).

This just the start of Fables, when we build things we want each step to be valuable and focus on creating meaningful stories. So what's on the Roadmap? We current have two areas of Fables, Telling the Story and Building the Story. Telling the Story helps with in the moment storytelling, when you are orating to others or in the zone and need to have quick influence to stay on a roll. 

## Tell the Story 

Tell the story is all about the creation of on the fly characters and how they interact in real time. This allows people to run games and add to the story without needing to go back and forth through notes, post-its and dense lore bibles. 

### Generators

Here the storyteller can quickly spin up a new item, group or character to add to an encounter or the story.

### Weighted Generators

True chaos isn't how you 

### Music player

Allows the group to play, listen to and add to playlists of music during the session

### Encounters

This allows the storyteller to track the events, actions and consequences of an encounter.

### Session summary

During a session the storyteller can record notes, see event logs, create/ view wiki entries and see companion character stats.

### DM screen

This single page screen allows the storyteller to swiftly interact with different parts of the Tell the story module.


## Build the story

Build the story is all about plotting out the state and future of your story. Adding wiki entries to your story and seeing the relationship between your characters.

### Character relationship map

An interactive diagram of how each character interacts with and is affected by the story and actions of other characters.

### Character profiles

A detailed entry with a history list of actions this character has taken. Character profiles are for any being in your story that would be considered an 'actor' in the narrative.

### Group profiles
